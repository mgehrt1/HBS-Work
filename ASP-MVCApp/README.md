Creating a web app using the ASP.NET and MVC frameworks. The app allows the user to keep track of items they have borrowed and lended, as well as their expenses. Introduced to the CRUD operations to make the app function as intended. Also introduced to using SQL servers to store data in a database which works in tandum with the web app in order to preserve the user's entries between uses of the app.

#### What I Learned?

I learned how to use the ASP.NET and MVC framework to create a dynamic web app with the CRUD operations. I also learned how to set up a SQL server and use that to work with my web app. Additional smaller topics were learned such as server/client side validation for user entries and some basic bootstrap capabilities.
