# MVC Tutorial

### Description

An introduction to MVC development through creating a web app. The app created displays a list of dogs that is added by the user. By default it is empty, but as the user adds dogs they will be displayed in a list.

### What I Learned?

I learned how to use the MVC framework. I learned how to create Models, and use a Controller to display them how I want in a View.
